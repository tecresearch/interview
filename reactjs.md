1. **What is React.js?**
   - React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications where UI updates dynamically.

2. **What are the main features of React?**
   - Virtual DOM, JSX, Component-Based Architecture, Unidirectional Data Flow, and Hooks.

3. **What is JSX in React?**
   - JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML in JavaScript.

4. **What is the Virtual DOM?**
   - A lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React uses to optimize rendering by updating only the changed parts.

5. **How does React handle data flow?**
   - React uses unidirectional data flow, meaning data is passed down from parent to child components.

6. **What is the difference between a class component and a functional component?**
   - Class components use lifecycle methods and state; functional components use hooks and are simpler to write.

7. **What are React Hooks?**
   - Functions like `useState` and `useEffect` that allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features.

8. **Explain useState hook.**
   - `useState` allows a functional component to manage state.

9. **What is useEffect in React?**
   - A hook that runs side effects in function components, like fetching data or DOM manipulation.

10. **How do you handle forms in React?**
    - Using controlled components where state manages input values.

11. **What is a controlled component?**
    - A component where form inputs are controlled by React state.

12. **What is an uncontrolled component?**
    - A form component where the DOM itself maintains the input state.

13. **What is the importance of keys in React lists?**
    - Keys help React efficiently update and render list items.

14. **What are props in React?**
    - Props (short for properties) allow data to be passed from parent to child components.

15. **What is Prop Drilling?**
    - The process of passing data through multiple levels of components unnecessarily.

16. **How do you avoid Prop Drilling?**
    - Using React Context API or Redux.

17. **What is Context API in React?**
    - A way to manage state globally and avoid prop drilling.

18. **What is Redux?**
    - A state management library that centralizes application state.

19. **What is the difference between Redux and Context API?**
    - Redux offers more structure and middleware support, while Context API is simpler but less feature-rich.

20. **What is React Router?**
    - A library for handling navigation in React applications.

21. **How do you implement routing in React?**
    - Using `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, and `Link` from React Router.

22. **What is lazy loading in React?**
    - A technique to load components asynchronously to improve performance.

23. **What is the difference between useMemo and useCallback?**
    - `useMemo` memoizes computed values, while `useCallback` memoizes functions.

24. **What is Refs in React?**
    - Refs allow direct access to DOM elements or component instances using useRef().

25. **How do you create a ref in React?**
    - Using `useRef()` for functional components.

26. **What is the difference between useRef and useState?**
    - `useRef` persists values without causing re-renders, unlike `useState`.

27. **What is HOC (Higher-Order Component) in React?**
    - A function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component.

28. **What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled inputs?**
    - Controlled inputs are managed by state, whereas uncontrolled inputs rely on the DOM.

29. **What is an Error Boundary in React?**
    - A class component that catches JavaScript errors in child components.

30. **How does React handle events?**
    - React uses synthetic events to provide cross-browser compatibility.

31. **What is reconciliation in React?**
    - The process React uses to update the UI efficiently using the Virtual DOM.

32. **What are portals in React?**
    - A way to render components outside the main DOM tree.

33. **How do you optimize React performance?**
    - Using memoization, Pure Components, lazy loading, and efficient state management.

34. **What is a Pure Component in React?**
    - A class component that implements `shouldComponentUpdate` for performance optimization.

35. **What is the difference between React.memo and useMemo?**
    - `React.memo` is used to memoize components, while `useMemo` is used for values.

36. **What is the difference between useState and useReducer?**
    - `useState` is simpler for managing local state, while `useReducer` is useful for complex state logic.

37. **How do you handle side effects in React?**
    - Using `useEffect` for operations like fetching data or DOM manipulation.

38. **What is a Fragment in React?**
    - A way to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

39. **What is React.StrictMode?**
    - A tool for highlighting potential issues in an application.

40. **What is the difference between useEffect and componentDidMount?**
    - `useEffect` is used in functional components, while `componentDidMount` is a lifecycle method in class components.

41. **How do you handle conditional rendering in React?**
    - Using ternary operators, logical && operators, or conditional statements.

42. **How do you fetch data in React?**
    - Using `fetch()`, Axios, or React Query inside `useEffect`.

43. **What is an event delegation in React?**
    - A pattern where a single event listener is attached to a parent instead of multiple children.

44. **How do you update state based on the previous state in React?**
    - By passing a function to `setState` instead of a value.

45. **What is hydration in React?**
    - The process of attaching event listeners to server-rendered HTML.

46. **How do you test React components?**
    - Using Jest and React Testing Library.

47. **What is a React Fiber?**
    - A new reconciliation algorithm for faster rendering.

48. **How do you handle global state in React?**
    - Using Context API, Redux, or Zustand.

49. **What is the difference between local and global state?**
    - Local state is managed within a component, while global state is shared across the app.

50. **What is Concurrent Mode in React?**
    - A set of experimental features to improve responsiveness and rendering.
