Explanation of Different Normal Forms in Database Normalization:
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Below are the different Normal Forms (NF):

1NF (First Normal Form) - Atomicity
Rules:

Each column must have atomic (indivisible) values.
Each column must contain values of a single type.
Each row must have a unique identifier (Primary Key).
Example (Not in 1NF):

Student_ID	Name	Courses
1	Alice	Math, Science
2	Bob	English, History
Problem: "Courses" column contains multiple values.

1NF Conversion:

Student_ID	Name	Course
1	Alice	Math
1	Alice	Science
2	Bob	English
2	Bob	History
2NF (Second Normal Form) - No Partial Dependency
Rules:

Must be in 1NF.
All non-key attributes must be fully dependent on the entire Primary Key (not just part of it).
Example (Not in 2NF):

Student_ID	Course_ID	Student_Name	Course_Name
1	101	Alice	Math
1	102	Alice	Science
2	103	Bob	English
Problem: Student_Name depends only on Student_ID, and Course_Name depends only on Course_ID (Partial Dependency).

2NF Conversion:

Student Table:

Student_ID	Student_Name
1	Alice
2	Bob
Course Table:

Course_ID	Course_Name
101	Math
102	Science
103	English
Enrollment Table: (Mapping Table)

Student_ID	Course_ID
1	101
1	102
2	103
3NF (Third Normal Form) - No Transitive Dependency
Rules:

Must be in 2NF.
There should be no transitive dependency (non-key attribute should not depend on another non-key attribute).
Example (Not in 3NF):

Student_ID	Student_Name	Course_ID	Course_Name	Instructor	Instructor_Department
1	Alice	101	Math	Dr. Smith	Mathematics
2	Bob	102	Science	Dr. John	Physics
Problem: Instructor_Department depends on Instructor, which is not a primary key (transitive dependency).

3NF Conversion:

Instructor Table:

Instructor	Instructor_Department
Dr. Smith	Mathematics
Dr. John	Physics
Course Table:

Course_ID	Course_Name	Instructor
101	Math	Dr. Smith
102	Science	Dr. John
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) - Advanced 3NF
Rules:

Must be in 3NF.
For every functional dependency (A → B), A must be a super key.
Example (Not in BCNF):

Teacher_ID	Subject	Department
1	Math	Science
2	Physics	Science
3	History	Arts
Problem: Department is functionally dependent on Subject, but Subject is not a super key.

BCNF Conversion:

Subject Table:

Subject	Department
Math	Science
Physics	Science
History	Arts
Teacher Table:

Teacher_ID	Subject
1	Math
2	Physics
3	History
4NF (Fourth Normal Form) - No Multi-Valued Dependencies
Rules:

Must be in BCNF.
A table should not contain multi-valued dependencies.
Example (Not in 4NF):

Student_ID	Course	Hobby
1	Math	Chess
1	Science	Chess
1	Math	Music
1	Science	Music
Problem: Course and Hobby are independent attributes but stored in the same table.

4NF Conversion:

Student_Course Table:

Student_ID	Course
1	Math
1	Science
Student_Hobby Table:

Student_ID	Hobby
1	Chess
1	Music
5NF (Fifth Normal Form) - No Join Dependency
Rules:

Must be in 4NF.
No join dependency, meaning the table should not split further without losing data.
Example (Not in 5NF):

Employee_ID	Project_ID	Location
1	P1	India
1	P2	USA
2	P1	India
2	P3	Germany
Problem: Employee, Project, and Location have independent relations but are combined.

5NF Conversion:

Employee_Project Table:

Employee_ID	Project_ID
1	P1
1	P2
2	P1
2	P3
Project_Location Table:

Project_ID	Location
P1	India
P2	USA
P3	Germany
Conclusion:
Normal Form	Main Rule
1NF	No duplicate columns, atomic values.
2NF	No partial dependencies on a composite key.
3NF	No transitive dependencies.
BCNF	Every determinant is a candidate key.
4NF	No multi-valued dependencies.
5NF	No join dependencies.
These normalization rules help create efficient, scalable, and easy-to-maintain databases.
