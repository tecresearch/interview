Basic Web API Interview Questions
1. What is a Web API?
Answer: A Web API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of HTTP-based endpoints that allow applications to communicate with each other over the internet. It enables data exchange between clients (frontend) and servers (backend).

2. How is a Web API different from a Web Service?
Answer:

Web API: Uses HTTP for communication and supports multiple formats like JSON and XML.
Web Service: A broader term that includes SOAP-based services and REST APIs.
3. What are the main HTTP methods used in Web APIs?
Answer:

GET – Retrieve data
POST – Create new data
PUT – Update existing data
DELETE – Remove data
PATCH – Partially update data
4. What is REST in Web API?
Answer: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses stateless communication over HTTP with standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

5. What is the difference between REST and SOAP?
Answer:

REST: Lightweight, uses JSON/XML, stateless, flexible.
SOAP: Heavy, uses only XML, includes built-in security and transaction support.

6. What are Status Codes in Web APIs?
Answer: HTTP status codes indicate the result of a request:

200 OK – Success
201 Created – Resource created
400 Bad Request – Invalid input
401 Unauthorized – Authentication required
403 Forbidden – Not allowed
404 Not Found – Resource missing
500 Internal Server Error – Server-side error
7. How do you handle authentication in Web APIs?
Answer:

Basic Authentication – Username and password in request headers.
Token-based Authentication – JWT (JSON Web Token).
OAuth2 – Secure third-party authentication.
API Keys – Unique key for access control.
8. How do you secure a Web API?
Answer:

Use HTTPS to encrypt data.
Implement JWT/OAuth2 for authentication.
Validate input data to prevent injection attacks.
Use rate limiting to prevent abuse.
9. What is CORS, and why is it needed in Web APIs?
Answer: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature that prevents unauthorized domains from accessing your API. It is required when APIs need to be accessed from different origins (e.g., frontend on example.com accessing an API on api.example.com).

10. What is HATEOAS in REST APIs?
Answer: HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a REST principle where the API responses include links to guide clients on possible next actions, making APIs more discoverable and dynamic.

Advanced Web API Interview Questions
11. What are the different types of API versioning?
Answer:

URL versioning: /v1/resource
Query parameter versioning: ?version=1
Header versioning: Accept-Version: 1
Media Type versioning: Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json
12. How do you implement pagination in Web APIs?
Answer: Use limit and offset or page and size parameters in requests:

arduino
Copy
Edit
GET /products?page=2&size=10
Include total count, next page, and previous page links in responses.

13. What is rate limiting in Web APIs?
Answer: Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a client can make in a given time to prevent abuse. It can be implemented using:

Token Bucket – Tokens are refilled over time.
Leaky Bucket – Requests are processed at a fixed rate.
Fixed Window – Limits requests per time window (e.g., 1000 requests per minute).
14. What is API Gateway, and why is it used?
Answer: An API Gateway manages API requests, providing authentication, rate limiting, caching, and routing. Examples: Kong, Nginx, AWS API Gateway.

15. How do you handle concurrency in Web APIs?
Answer:

Optimistic Locking – Clients include a version number; updates fail if the version is outdated.
Pessimistic Locking – Lock records while updating to prevent conflicts.
Queueing – Process requests asynchronously using message queues like RabbitMQ.
16. How do you test Web APIs?
Answer:

Unit Testing: Test individual endpoints using Jest, Mocha, JUnit.
Integration Testing: Verify API interactions using Postman, RestAssured.
Performance Testing: Simulate load with JMeter or K6.
17. How do you ensure backward compatibility in Web APIs?
Answer:

Implement API versioning.
Use feature flags to enable new features gradually.
Deprecate old endpoints gracefully with warnings.
18. How do you monitor Web APIs in production?
Answer:

Logging: Use structured logs with tools like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
Monitoring: Use Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic for API health tracking.
Alerting: Set up alerts for failures, high response times, and error spikes.
19. What are WebSockets, and how are they different from REST APIs?
Answer:

WebSockets enable real-time communication between clients and servers.
Unlike REST, WebSockets maintain an open connection, allowing bidirectional data flow without repeated requests.
20. How do you design an API for a real-world e-commerce application?
Answer:

Authentication: JWT/OAuth2 for user login.
Endpoints: /products, /cart, /orders, /users.
Caching: Redis for fast product lookup.
Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse with API gateway rules.
Monitoring: Log API requests and errors with a monitoring tool.



Complex and Logical REST API Interview Questions and Answers

Deep Understanding of REST Architecture:

Q: Explain the difference between RESTful APIs and SOAP APIs. When would you choose one over the other?
A: RESTful APIs are lightweight, use JSON for data exchange, and are stateless, while SOAP APIs use XML and provide built-in security and transaction compliance. Choose REST for web and mobile applications due to its simplicity and performance, and SOAP for enterprise applications requiring high security and ACID compliance.

Q: How does the stateless nature of REST impact API design and performance?
A: Statelessness improves scalability and reliability since each request contains all necessary information. However, it requires efficient caching and authentication mechanisms.

Q: Discuss the concept of HATEOAS and how it enhances REST APIs.
A: HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) allows clients to dynamically navigate APIs through links provided in responses, making APIs more discoverable and adaptable.

Q: What are idempotent methods in REST, and why are they important?
A: Idempotent methods (e.g., GET, PUT, DELETE) ensure that making multiple identical requests does not change the resource state, improving reliability and preventing unintended modifications.

API Design and Best Practices:

Q: How do you design a RESTful API for a large-scale system with millions of users?
A: Use load balancers, caching, pagination, rate limiting, and database optimization strategies. Employ microservices architecture for better scalability.

Q: Discuss the best practices for handling pagination in REST APIs.
A: Use limit and offset parameters, provide total record count, include next and previous links, and optimize database queries for efficiency.

Q: Explain different ways to implement API versioning and their trade-offs.
A: Methods include URI versioning (/v1/resource), query parameters (?version=1), and headers (Accept-Version). URI versioning is simple but less flexible, while headers provide better separation.

Q: How would you prevent over-fetching and under-fetching of data in a REST API?
A: Use techniques like GraphQL, sparse fieldsets, and resource expansion to fetch only necessary data efficiently.

Security and Authentication:

Q: Explain how OAuth2 works and how it differs from JWT authentication.
A: OAuth2 is an authorization framework using access tokens, while JWT is a self-contained authentication token that contains claims. OAuth2 is suitable for third-party authentication, whereas JWT is better for sessionless authentication.

Q: What are the key security threats to REST APIs, and how do you mitigate them?
A: Threats include SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and API abuse. Mitigation strategies include input validation, CORS policies, rate limiting, and using HTTPS.

Q: How can you implement role-based access control (RBAC) in a REST API?
A: Use middleware to check user roles against protected endpoints and assign permissions based on roles stored in a database or JWT claims.

Q: What is the difference between API Gateway and authentication middleware?
A: API Gateway manages and routes requests with additional functionalities like rate limiting, while authentication middleware verifies user credentials and permissions at the application level.

Performance Optimization and Caching:

Q: How does caching improve API performance, and what are different caching strategies?
A: Caching reduces server load by storing frequently requested data. Strategies include client-side caching, proxy caching, and database query caching.

Q: Discuss the impact of using HTTP/2 on REST API performance.
A: HTTP/2 enables multiplexing, header compression, and request prioritization, leading to faster API responses and reduced latency.

Q: Explain rate limiting and throttling in APIs. How would you implement them?
A: Rate limiting restricts the number of requests per user/IP to prevent abuse. It can be implemented using API gateways or middleware like Redis-based counters.

Q: How do you handle high concurrency scenarios in a REST API?
A: Use connection pooling, database indexing, horizontal scaling, caching, and event-driven architecture for better concurrency handling.

Error Handling and Logging:

Q: What is the best way to structure error responses in a REST API?
A: Use standardized formats like JSON with status codes, error messages, and error codes. Example:

{
  "error": "Invalid input",
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Username cannot be empty"
}

Q: Explain the importance of logging and monitoring in REST API applications.
A: Logging helps diagnose issues, while monitoring provides insights into API health and performance. Tools like ELK Stack and Prometheus are commonly used.

Q: How do you handle partial failures in a REST API that involves multiple microservices?
A: Implement circuit breakers, retries, and fallback mechanisms to ensure resilience.

Q: Discuss the significance of correlation IDs in API request tracking.
A: Correlation IDs help trace requests across distributed systems for better debugging and monitoring.

Advanced Topics:

Q: How would you design an event-driven REST API architecture?
A: Use event brokers like Kafka to trigger actions based on API events and implement webhook subscriptions.

Q: Explain how REST APIs can be used in microservices-based applications.
A: Each microservice exposes REST endpoints, and API gateways manage routing, security, and aggregation.

Q: Discuss the pros and cons of using gRPC over REST in a high-performance application.
A: gRPC offers lower latency and better performance with binary serialization but lacks human readability and widespread browser support.

Q: How would you implement real-time communication in a REST-based system?
A: Use WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE), or long polling for real-time updates.
