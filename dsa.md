5. **Q:** How is a queue different from a stack?
   **A:** A queue follows FIFO (First In, First Out), whereas a stack follows LIFO.

6. **Q:** What is a priority queue?
   **A:** A priority queue is a special queue where elements are dequeued based on priority, not insertion order.

    **A:** It represents a graph using a list of neighbors for each vertex.

29. **Q:** What is a graph adjacency matrix?
    **A:** It represents a graph using a 2D matrix, where matrix[i][j] denotes an edge.

30. **Q:** Explain backtracking with an example.
    **A:** Backtracking explores all possible options and backtracks when a solution isn’t possible. Example: N-Queens problem.

31. **Q:** What is the complexity of inserting into a binary heap?
    **A:** O(log n).

32. **Q:** What is the worst-case complexity of BST search?
    **A:** O(n), in the case of a skewed tree.

33. **Q:** How do you check if a binary tree is a BST?
    **A:** Perform an in-order traversal and check if elements are in sorted order.

    **A:** A maximal subgraph where every vertex is reachable from every other.

38. **Q:** What is Bellman-Ford’s algorithm used for?
    **A:** Finding the shortest path, even with negative weight edges.
