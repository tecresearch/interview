## Top 50 Interview Questions and Answers:

### 1. API (Application Programming Interface)
**Q1:** What is an API, and why is it used?
- **A:** An API is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It is used for data exchange between client and server applications.

**Q2:** What are RESTful APIs?
- **A:** RESTful APIs follow REST principles, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and stateless operations to exchange data in formats like JSON or XML.

_(For more API-related questions, refer to `api_questions.txt`)_

### 2. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
**Q3:** What are the four pillars of OOP?
- **A:** Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

**Q4:** Explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding.
- **A:** Overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters. Overriding happens when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.

### 3. C++
**Q5:** What is a constructor in C++?
- **A:** A constructor is a special function in a class that initializes objects automatically when they are created.

**Q6:** Explain the difference between pointers and references in C++.
- **A:** Pointers store memory addresses and can be reassigned, whereas references act as aliases and cannot be changed once assigned.

_(For more C++-related questions, refer to `cpp_questions.txt`)_

### 4. Java
**Q7:** What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()` in Java?
- **A:** `==` checks for reference equality, while `.equals()` checks for value equality.

**Q8:** What is a Java interface?
- **A:** An interface is a collection of abstract methods that classes can implement.

_(For more Java-related questions, refer to `java_questions.txt`)_

### 5. MERN Stack
**Q9:** What is the MERN stack?
- **A:** MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, which together form a full-stack JavaScript framework.

**Q10:** How does React handle state management?
- **A:** React uses `useState` for local state and `useContext` or Redux for global state management.

_(For more MERN-related questions, refer to `mern_questions.txt`)_

### 6. J2EE
**Q11:** What is J2EE used for?
- **A:** J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition) is used for developing large-scale enterprise applications with technologies like Servlets, JSP, and EJB.

**Q12:** Explain the lifecycle of a servlet.
- **A:** A servlet follows these phases: Loading -> Instantiation -> Initialization (`init()`) -> Service (`doGet()`/`doPost()`) -> Destruction (`destroy()`).

_(For more J2EE-related questions, refer to `j2ee_questions.txt`)_

### 7. Spring Framework
**Q13:** What is dependency injection in Spring?
- **A:** Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where the Spring container injects dependencies at runtime instead of creating them manually.

**Q14:** Explain Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming).
- **A:** AOP allows separation of cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) using aspects, advice, and pointcuts.

_(For more Spring-related questions, refer to `spring_questions.txt`)_

### 8. Spring Boot
**Q15:** What are the advantages of using Spring Boot?
- **A:** Spring Boot simplifies Java development with auto-configuration, embedded servers, and minimal boilerplate code.

**Q16:** What is the difference between `@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` annotations?
- **A:** All three are Spring stereotypes, but `@Repository` is used for DAO layers, `@Service` for business logic, and `@Component` for general beans.
