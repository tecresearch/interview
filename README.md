Top 50 Interview Questions and Answers:

1. API (Application Programming Interface)

Q1: What is an API, and why is it used?

A: An API is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It is used for data exchange between client and server applications.


Q2: What are RESTful APIs?

A: RESTful APIs follow REST principles, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and stateless operations to exchange data in formats like JSON or XML.


(For more API-related questions, refer to api_questions.txt)

2. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

Q3: What are the four pillars of OOP?

A: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.


Q4: Explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding.

A: Overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters. Overriding happens when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.

3. C++

Q5: What is a constructor in C++?

A: A constructor is a special function in a class that initializes objects automatically when they are created.


Q6: Explain the difference between pointers and references in C++.

A: Pointers store memory addresses and can be reassigned, whereas references act as aliases and cannot be changed once assigned.


(For more C++-related questions, refer to cpp_questions.txt)

4. Java

Q7: What is the difference between == and .equals() in Java?

A: == checks for reference equality, while .equals() checks for value equality.


Q8: What is a Java interface?

A: An interface is a collection of abstract methods that classes can implement.

5. MERN Stack

Q9: What is the MERN stack?

A: MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, which together form a full-stack JavaScript framework.


Q10: How does React handle state management?

A: React uses useState for local state and useContext or Redux for global state management.


(For more MERN-related questions, refer to mern_questions.txt)

6. J2EE

Q11: What is J2EE used for?

A: J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition) is used for developing large-scale enterprise applications with technologies like Servlets, JSP, and EJB.


Q12: Explain the lifecycle of a servlet.

A: A servlet follows these phases: Loading -> Instantiation -> Initialization (init()) -> Service (doGet()/doPost()) -> Destruction (destroy()).


(For more J2EE-related questions, refer to j2ee_questions.txt)

7. Spring Framework

Q13: What is dependency injection in Spring?

A: Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where the Spring container injects dependencies at runtime instead of creating them manually.


Q14: Explain Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming).

A: AOP allows separation of cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) using aspects, advice, and pointcuts.


(For more Spring-related questions, refer to spring_questions.txt)

8. Spring Boot

Q15: What are the advantages of using Spring Boot?

A: Spring Boot simplifies Java development with auto-configuration, embedded servers, and minimal boilerplate code.


Q16: What is the difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository annotations?

A: All three are Spring stereotypes, but @Repository is used for DAO layers, @Service for business logic, and @Component for general beans.
