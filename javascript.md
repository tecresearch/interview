1. Q: What is JavaScript?
   A: JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language used to create dynamic web content.

2. Q: Explain the difference between `let`, `var`, and `const`.
   A: `var` is function-scoped, `let` is block-scoped, and `const` is block-scoped but cannot be reassigned.

3. Q: What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?
   A: `==` checks for value equality with type coercion, while `===` checks for strict equality (value and type).

4. Q: What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in JavaScript?
   A: `this` refers to the current execution context and can vary based on function invocation.

5. Q: What are closures in JavaScript?
   A: A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope even after the outer function has returned.

6. Q: Explain event delegation in JavaScript.
   A: Event delegation is a technique where a parent element handles events for its child elements using event bubbling.

7. Q: What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?
   A: Synchronous execution blocks further code until the task is completed, while asynchronous execution allows other tasks to continue.

8. Q: What are promises in JavaScript?
   A: Promises represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never. They have states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

9. Q: What is the difference between `call`, `apply`, and `bind`?
   A: `call` invokes a function with arguments passed individually, `apply` passes arguments as an array, and `bind` returns a new function with a fixed `this` value.

10. Q: Explain the concept of hoisting.
    A: Hoisting moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.

11. Q: What is the difference between null and undefined?
    A: `null` is an assigned value representing "no value," while `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.

12. Q: What are arrow functions?
    A: Arrow functions are a concise syntax for defining functions, and they do not have their own `this` value.

13. Q: What is the use of `setTimeout` and `setInterval`?
    A: `setTimeout` executes a function after a specified delay, while `setInterval` repeats execution at set intervals.

14. Q: What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?
    A: An IIFE is a function that executes immediately after being defined.

15. Q: What is debouncing and throttling?
    A: Debouncing delays function execution until after a specified time, while throttling limits execution to a specified rate.

16. Q: What are JavaScript modules?
    A: Modules allow code to be divided into separate files and imported/exported using `import` and `export`.

17. Q: What is the event loop in JavaScript?
    A: The event loop handles asynchronous operations by continuously checking the call stack and message queue.

18. Q: What is the purpose of `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`?
    A: `JSON.stringify` converts an object to a JSON string, and `JSON.parse` converts a JSON string back to an object.

19. Q: How does localStorage differ from sessionStorage?
    A: `localStorage` stores data permanently unless cleared, while `sessionStorage` stores data for the session duration.

20. Q: Explain the difference between deep copy and shallow copy.
    A: A shallow copy copies references, while a deep copy creates a completely independent clone.

21. Q: What is destructuring in JavaScript?
    A: Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.

22. Q: What are template literals?
    A: Template literals allow embedding expressions inside string literals using backticks (`` ` ``).

23. Q: Explain the spread and rest operators.
    A: The spread operator (`...`) expands elements, while the rest operator (`...`) collects remaining elements into an array.

24. Q: What is function currying?
    A: Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each taking a single argument.

25. Q: What are generators in JavaScript?
    A: Generators are functions that can pause and resume execution using the `yield` keyword.

26. Q: What are symbols in JavaScript?
    A: Symbols are unique and immutable primitive data types used as object property keys.

27. Q: How does the `map` method differ from `forEach`?
    A: `map` returns a new array, while `forEach` modifies elements in place.

28. Q: What is the purpose of the `reduce` function?
    A: `reduce` accumulates values in an array into a single result.

29. Q: Explain the difference between `splice` and `slice`.
    A: `splice` modifies the original array, while `slice` creates a new array with selected elements.

30. Q: What is the purpose of the `Object.freeze` method?
    A: `Object.freeze` makes an object immutable.

31. Q: How can you check if an object is an array?
    A: Use `Array.isArray(object)`.

32. Q: What is the difference between prototypal and classical inheritance?
    A: Prototypal inheritance is prototype-based, while classical inheritance is class-based.

33. Q: What is an async function?
    A: An `async` function always returns a promise and allows `await` inside it.

34. Q: What are WeakMap and WeakSet?
    A: WeakMap and WeakSet allow weakly held object references to prevent memory leaks.

35. Q: Explain the `fetch` API.
    A: The `fetch` API is used to make HTTP requests and returns a Promise.

36. Q: What is `Object.assign` used for?
    A: It copies properties from one or more objects to a target object.

37. Q: How do you deep clone an object?
    A: Use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object))` or `structuredClone(object)`.

38. Q: What is tail recursion optimization?
    A: Tail recursion optimization allows recursive functions to execute without growing the call stack.

39. Q: How do you handle errors in JavaScript?
    A: Use `try...catch` blocks.

40. Q: What is a service worker?
    A: A service worker is a script that runs in the background, enabling features like offline support.

41. Q: How does the `||` (OR) operator work in JavaScript?
    A: It returns the first truthy value or the last value if none are truthy.

42. Q: What is the purpose of the `??` (nullish coalescing operator)?
    A: It returns the right-hand value only if the left-hand value is `null` or `undefined`.

43. Q: What is an ES6 class?
    A: ES6 classes provide a syntax for object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

44. Q: Explain object destructuring in function parameters.
    A: Function parameters can be destructured for better readability.

45. Q: What is a polyfill?
    A: A polyfill is a code snippet that provides modern functionality in older browsers.

46. Q: What are typed arrays?
    A: Typed arrays provide a way to handle binary data efficiently.

47. Q: How do you convert a string to a number?
    A: Use `parseInt()`, `parseFloat()`, or the `Number()` function.

48. Q: What is function composition?
    A: Function composition is combining multiple functions to produce a new function.

49. Q: How does the `instanceof` operator work?
    A: It checks if an object is an instance of a specific class.

50. Q: What is a WeakRef?
    A: A WeakRef holds a weak reference to an object to prevent memory leaks.
