11. Q: What is Spring Boot DevTools?
    A: DevTools enhances developer productivity by enabling features like auto-restart, live reload, and debugging support.

12. Q: How do you create a Spring Boot project?
    A: Use Spring Initializr (start.spring.io) or create a project manually with Maven/Gradle dependencies.

13. Q: What is @SpringBootApplication?
    A: It is a combination of @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan, serving as the entry point for Spring Boot applications.

14. Q: How do you handle exceptions globally in Spring Boot?
    A: Use @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler to define global exception-handling logic.

    A: It combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, simplifying RESTful service creation.

16. Q: What is the difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository?
    A: All are Spring-managed beans, but @Service is for business logic, @Repository is for database operations, and @Component is a generic stereotype.

17. Q: How do you connect a Spring Boot application to a database?
    A: Configure `spring.datasource.url`, `username`, and `password` in application.properties and use Spring Data JPA or JDBC.

18. Q: What is Spring Data JPA?
    A: It is a module that simplifies database interactions using repositories, eliminating boilerplate code.

19. Q: How do you define an entity in Spring Boot?
    A: Use @Entity, @Table, and @Id annotations in a class representing a database table.

20. Q: What is the difference between CrudRepository and JpaRepository?
    A: JpaRepository extends CrudRepository and provides additional features like pagination and batch processing.

21. Q: How do you implement pagination in Spring Boot?
    A: Use Pageable in repository methods, e.g., `findAll(Pageable pageable)`.

22. Q: What is Spring Boot Security?
    A: It provides authentication and authorization features using filters and configurations.

23. Q: How do you secure a REST API in Spring Boot?
    A: Use Spring Security with JWT, OAuth2, or Basic Authentication.

24. Q: What is JWT authentication?
    A: JWT (JSON Web Token) is a token-based authentication mechanism used to secure APIs.

25. Q: How do you enable CORS in a Spring Boot application?
    A: Use `@CrossOrigin` annotation or configure CORS globally via WebMvcConfigurer.

26. Q: What is Spring Boot caching?
    A: It provides caching support using @Cacheable, @CacheEvict, and @EnableCaching annotations.

27. Q: How do you configure logging in Spring Boot?
    A: Use application.properties (logging.level.root=INFO) or logback.xml.

28. Q: What is Spring Boot Microservices?
    A: A way to develop independent, scalable services that communicate over REST APIs.

29. Q: How do you enable Swagger in a Spring Boot application?
    A: Add Springfox dependency and annotate controllers with @Api and @ApiOperation.

30. Q: What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous processing in Spring Boot?
    A: Synchronous processing blocks execution until a task completes, while asynchronous processing executes tasks concurrently using @Async.

31. Q: What is @Bean in Spring Boot?
    A: It defines a bean in a Spring configuration class.

32. Q: What is the use of @Primary annotation?
    A: It marks a bean as the primary candidate for autowiring when multiple beans of the same type exist.

33. Q: How does Spring Boot handle circular dependencies?
    A: By throwing a BeanCurrentlyInCreationException or resolving it using @Lazy.

34. Q: What is an ApplicationRunner in Spring Boot?
    A: It is an interface used to execute logic after the application starts.

35. Q: What is Spring Boot Scheduler?
    A: It schedules tasks using @Scheduled annotation with cron expressions.

36. Q: How do you enable asynchronous processing in Spring Boot?
    A: Use @EnableAsync and @Async annotations.

    A: @Transactional manages individual transactions, while @EnableTransactionManagement enables transaction support.

    A: Use @Value annotation or bind properties using @ConfigurationProperties.

39. Q: What is Circuit Breaker in Spring Boot?
    A: A resilience pattern to prevent service failures using Hystrix or Resilience4j.
